# JavaPasswordGen

A web-based tool that allows employees to generate random passwords based on their chosen criteria. I wrote JavaScript code that dynamically updates the HTML and CSS, resulting in a polished and responsive user interface that can adapt to different screen sizes. Additionally, the passwords generated by the application can contain special characters.
